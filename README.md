# 🌧️ Rain Detection & Prediction System

An embedded systems project focused on rain detection and prediction to automatically control a motorized clothes drying rack.
The system detects rainfall conditions and extends or retracts the rack automatically to protect clothes from rain, integrating both hardware control and a web-based monitoring interface.

Detailed system design, implementation, and logic are documented in `documentation.pdf` located in the project root directory.
